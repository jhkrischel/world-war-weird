# Recovery from consequences

Mild consequences last for 1 scene after the recovery action is made.

Moderate consequences last until the end of the session the recovery action is made in.

Severe consequences last until the end of the scenario the recovery action is made in.

This tends to make it worthwhile to take consequences at the end of a session or scenario, since they'll recover pretty quickly.

# Concessions

Defender may decide to concede after an attack roll, but before their defense roll.  Any fate points spent by the attacker to the final attack roll are refunded.

Defender may decide to concede after their defense roll, *only* if the attack roll has not happened.

The defender may decide the order of the rolls.

Only supporting NPCs and main NPCs may concede - nameless NPCs (aka Mooks) cannot concede.

Note: FAE only supports the second version of concession.

# Creating a Scene Aspect

* Creating a Scene Aspect with a fate point gives you one free invoke on that aspect
	* you may use that invoke immediately
* You can use an appropriate "Create Advantage" skill to create a Scene Aspect
	* GM to determine target difficulty, or if NPCs may defend against it
* A Scene Aspect suggested by a PC can be agreed to immediately by the GM
	* by default, there are no free invokes on this scene aspect
* Secret or Hidden aspects can be discovered by certain skills using "Create Advantage"
	* Tie or better means the aspect is discovered
	* Aspect does not come with any free invokes
	* An aspect can be common knowledge to the *players* but still require a "Create Advantage" roll by the *character* to discover it
	* Skills that can "discover" aspects with "Create Advantage" (discovered aspect must be related to the skill in question)
		* Burglary
		* Contacts
		* Crafts
		* Empathy
		* Fighting
		* Investigation
		* Lore
		* Notice
		* Shooting

# Create Advantages in combat

## Grappling

* Physique vs. physique to establish grapple (create advantage)
* Physique vs. physique to break grapple (overcome)
	* Some actions are completely forbidden to attempt until grapple is broken, for example moving
* Free 1-stress hit inflicted by grappler every round grapple is maintained after the first
* Grappler may use Fighting attack against pinned character without losing grapple
* Grappler may use Fighting attack against other character with -2 penalty without losing grapple
* Grappler may not use Shooting attack without losing grapple
* Grappler may attempt to change zones with the pinned character without losing grapple
    * Pinned character may resist zone change with Physique
    * "Failure with style" by the grappler means the grapple is lost
* Free active resistance by physique if pinned character is trying something that can be interfered with (but is still otherwise permissible without an overcome roll first)
	* If pinned character succeeds with interfered action, grapple is broken
	* Pinned character rolls once, resistance skills either stack or roll separately
		* E.g., pinned character attempts Fighting attack against grappler
			* Grappler rolls once, but stacks Physique and Fighting to defend
			* If action would have succeeded against Physique alone, grapple is broken, but attack fails
		* E.g., pinned character attempts Fighting attack against nearby non-grappling character
			* Grappler rolls once with Physique to interfere
			* If pinned character beats grappler, the non-grappling character gets a defense roll against the pinned character's original roll

## Covering fire

* Create advantage roll against difficulty determined by GM (how difficult is it to cover the area in question)
* Free active resistance against movement through the area (athletics/stealth overcome roll)
	* If resistance is successful, moving character may choose to avoid movement (forced to stay put), or to take a 1-shift hit from the shooter (weapon damage and armor are not applied to this 1-shift hit).
* Free active resistance against Shooting attacks through the area
	* If resistance is successful, attacking character may choose to avoid attack (forced to stay down), or to take a 1-shift hit from the shooter (weapon damage and armor are not applied to this 1-shift hit) and make their attack.
* Covering fire aspect is removed if shooter decides to make a direct attack

# Skills

## Ride

The Ride skill covers riding horses and other more exotic animals, as well as piloting animal-driven vehicles like wagons and stage coaches.

* Overcome: Ride is the equivalent of Athletics when you’re on horseback (or other-creature-back) or when you’re piloting one of the aforementioned vehicles. Use it to do difficult things or to do normal things under difficult circumstances, like moving through rough terrain, squeezing through small spaces, jumping chasms, and so forth.
* Create an Advantage: You might use Ride to put some distance between yourself and a pursuer, get some extra speed from your horse, or declare that you know a <aspect>Convenient Shortcut</aspect> or something similar.
* Attack: By default, Ride isn’t an attack skill.
* Defend: You’ll use Ride to defend against most attacks made against you while you’re on horseback;
you can also use it to defend when your mount is under attack.

### Ride Stunts

* <em>Animal Ken:</em> You can use Ride as if it were Empathy when you’re communicating with domestic animals; you can also use it as if it were Rapport or Intimidate, but you can only communicate basic ideas and simple directions. If you spend a fate point, you can use this stunt on wild animals for the rest of the scene.
* <em>Ride Like the Wind:</em> You get a +2 to Ride bonuses made to create speed-based advantages.
* <em>The Whistle:</em> You can spend a fate point and whistle for your horse, and she’ll show up within a few exchanges. It has to be <em>your</em> horse, a horse you’ve owned for a while and created a bond with. Your horse’s arrival can be improbable, but if the GM deems it impossible that he’d be there, you get your fate point back.

## Survival

Survival is the skill of living off the land, finding shelter, identifying useful (and dangerous) things out in nature, and generally keeping yourself alive when you’re not near civilization.

* Overcome: When you overcome an obstacle, you’re finding a place to stay during a storm, gathering food for yourself and your friends, tracking a fugitive through the woods, and so forth. Not getting lost is also a big one and, beyond that, navigating from one point of civilization to another.
* Create an Advantage: Advantages often come in the form of preparations you’ve made beforehand, like setting a snare or gathering firewood. An advantage could also represent your knowledge of the land (or an opponent’s lack of knowledge). Maybe you know that bush over there has <aspect>Riled Up Vipers</aspect> in it and the guy with the gun doesn’t.
* Attack: Survival isn’t used for attack.
* Defense: Survival isn’t generally used for defense either. That said, if the GM wants to model a storm or starvation or some other thing as an attack against you, Survival is the skill you’d be most likely to defend with (either that or Endurance).

### Survival Stunts

* <em>Herb Lore:</em> As long as you’re in a natural environment with access to plants and herbs, you can use Survival instead of Lore to treat wounds and sickness.
* <em>Pathfinder:</em> You never get lost, even in the worst weather, even in unfamiliar surroundings. You’ve got an internal compass that’s always right and you always know which way is north and the general direction of major landmarks. If you ever find yourself in truly alien surroundings (like maybe you’re in the Folklands and you’ve never been there and don’t know how things work up there), you’re still always allowed to make a Survival roll against Good (+3) opposition to know where you are in relation to landmarks you do know.
* <em>Tracker:</em> You get a +2 to Survival rolls made to find and follow tracks in natural environments.
