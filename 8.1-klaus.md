# Klaus Grueber

# High Concept: Cybernetic Enforcer of Medusa

Klaus was a mook in the Medusa organization until things went bad during a fight, and he lost nearly half of his body to burn damage.  The techs of Medusa rebuilt him with alien technology, and he now serves as their chief enforcer, sent to clean up messes others have been unable to fix.

# Trouble: Losing my mind to alien influence

The implants and technology that keep Klaus alive have been intermittently driving him to act in service of another agenda, unknown to him or Medusa.

# First Adventure: Poor Impulse Control

Klaus has anger management issues.

# Guest Star: I don't know my own strength

The additional cybernetic gear makes it difficult to use finesse, but easy to cause collateral damage.

# Guest Star: Sir, yes sir!

Klaus, first and foremost, is a follower.  He takes orders, and takes them well.
