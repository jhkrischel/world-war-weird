# World War Weird

## Alternate Timeline

Germany maintains their alliance with the Soviets in November of 1940 negotiations, adding them to the Tripartite Pact.

Soviet support of the Axis, in particular Japan, makes the American-British-Dutch sanctions meaningless, and Japan doesn't draw the United States into the war.  November 20, 1941, negotiations between Japan and the US fail, but are nominally continued indefinitely, with Japan unscathed by US economic policy.  Japan's rampage through China and South East Asia continue unchecked.

Britain falls in December of 1942 to German forces.  As the last remnants of the old British regime are hunted down, an Anglican Bishop activates an ancient alien artifact held by the Church, and unleashes a zombie plague.  German forces retreat to mainland Europe to escape the plague, and although a quarantine is attempted, the plague makes its way into the European population.

1943 is a year of retrenchment.  Cities are closed off, trade grinds to a halt, and zombies roam throughout Eurasia.  The Tripartite Pact dissolves in chaos, and only Australia and the Americas remain "clean", with strict naval blockades.  Refugees are regularly slaughtered at sea to avoid zombie contamination.  Britain's last human falls victim to the zombie plague on November 11, 1943.

The "Manhattan Project" is started in the United States, with the goal of finding a cure for the zombie plague.  In order to accomplish this, the most brilliant remaining scientists in the world need to be rescued from the cities they have sheltered in throughout Europe, Asia, and Africa.  A special extraction team is formed to perform the rescues.

To aid the team in their task, secret government access to other ancient alien artifacts is given.  Superior weapons and equipment, and even some experimental biological engineering procedures, are used to give our heroes the edge they need against the zombie threat.
