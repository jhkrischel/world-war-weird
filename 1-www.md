# World War Weird

## Alternate Timeline

Germany maintains their alliance with the Soviets in November of 1940 negotiations, adding them to the Tripartite Pact.

Soviet support of the Axis, in particular Japan, makes the American-British-Dutch sanctions meaningless, and Japan doesn't draw the United States into the war.  November 20, 1941, negotiations between Japan and the US fail, but are nominally continued indefinitely, with Japan unscathed by US economic policy.  Japan's rampage through China and South East Asia continue unchecked.

Britain falls in December of 1942 to German forces.  As the last remnants of the old British regime are hunted down, an Anglican Bishop activates an ancient alien artifact held by the Church, and unleashes a zombie plague.  German forces retreat to mainland Europe to escape the plague, and although a quarantine is attempted, the plague makes its way into the European population.

1943 is a year of retrenchment.  Cities are closed off, trade grinds to a halt, and zombies roam throughout Eurasia.  The Tripartite Pact dissolves in chaos, and only Australia and the Americas remain "clean", with strict naval blockades.  Refugees are regularly slaughtered at sea to avoid zombie contamination.  Britain's last human falls victim to the zombie plague on November 11, 1943.

The "Manhattan Project" is started in the United States, with the goal of finding a cure for the zombie plague.  In order to accomplish this, the most brilliant remaining scientists in the world need to be rescued from the cities they have sheltered in throughout Europe, Asia, and Africa.  A special extraction team is formed to perform the rescues.

To aid the team in their task, secret government access to other ancient alien artifacts is given.  Superior weapons and equipment, and even some experimental biological engineering procedures, are used to give our heroes the edge they need against the zombie threat.

## The Zombie Plague

The initial plague was transmitted instantaneously through a force wave generated by the alien artifact for a radius of approximately 5 miles.  Symptoms of infection occurred immediately in approximately 10% of the population, while the others took 24 hours to register symptoms.

Zombie infected humans become immune to pain, and are compelled to attack other humans to infect them through biting.  Subsequent waves of infection have shown incubation times anywhere from 24 to 72 hours.

While zombies feast on human flesh, they generally do not eat enough of a human to prevent zombification.  Approximately 50% of corpses killed and partially eaten by zombies generally animate within 24 to 72 hours - the other 50% simply decay, but can transmit the zombie plague if handled for up to three weeks.  Because of the potentially contagious nature of corpses, they are generally burned in place, or left to rot.

While generally uncoordinated, large groups of humans sometimes attract zombie hordes of several hundred.  Current city fortresses generally shoot on sight, and maintain strict defensive boundary walls which are generally unscalable by zombies.  Zombies are also unable to swim, and tend to avoid water.

Few survivors are ever allowed into cities, both because of the fear of infection, as well as the lack of adequate food and water.  Survivors who manage to approach city fortresses without getting shot indiscriminately by the authorities, are subject to strict quarantine for five days minimum.  Some armored patrols are sent out from the cities, but their return also triggers five day minimum quarantine.

Zombies are more active at night, and are able to track human prey surprisingly well, using thermal vision, and a supernatural sense of smell.  Although generally shambling, if in pursuit of prey, they become much faster (although not quite standard human speed).

As of 1944, Great Britain is 100% zombie infected, with no human survivors left.  Europe, which took the brunt of the zombie plague before defenses were put in place, is upwards of 70% infected.  Africa and Asia are approximately 40% infected.
