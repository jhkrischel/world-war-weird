## Invokes

* Nome loves having an audience, so he can spend a fate point to either re-roll or get a +2 on a Shoot attack when his friends are around.

## Compels

* Event: You have the **Hey guys watch this!** aspect, and there is a very determined bad guy who remembers your bragging, unfortunately, he noticed you're in town, and is now on the hunt.  Damn your luck.

* Decision: You have the **Hey guys, watch this!** aspect, and you have clean shot at a target, and decide to brag about just how good your sight picture is.  This goes wrong when the target disappears from view while you've busy bragging.
