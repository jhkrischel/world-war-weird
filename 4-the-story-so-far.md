# January 1, 1944 - Echo Base Australia

The team practices against robot drones in a simulated hostage rescue mission in the middle of the outback.

# January 6, 1944 to January 14, 1944 - New Free Saigon

The team makes it through the jungle, past the quarantine, past four Ninjas of Medusa, to finally rescue and return Dr. Vinh Man Dan.

# Jaunary 20, 1944 to February 14, 1944 - The Forbidden City

The team arrives at Tianjin, and convoys to Beijing.  Yvormes and Dr. Google perform an analysis on an alien artifact held by the Chinese army, and determine it to be a power source.

When finally sent to meet Chow Yin Fat, they find him missing from his office, kidnapped by Medusa.  They find the mole, and trace her back to Du Tu Soon, an opium addled spymaster.

Interrogating Du Tu Soon, the team performs a successful canyon ambush, and rescues Chow Yin Fat.  Chow Yin Fat was tagged with a subdermal tracking bug, disabled by Dr. Google with some tin foil.  Unfortunately, their escape plan was disrupted when the helicopters they brought got into a fight with enemy helicopters, so they retreated to a nearby abandoned mine complex.

After evading zombies in the mine complex, the team had to evade Medusa patrols until they could be picked up by helicopter for flight back to Beijing.

Arriving in Beijing, the team finds the city in chaos.  Someone actually killed some guards and made a purposeful breach in the city shortly after midnight, and zombies have been rampaging until dawn.  Dropped off in the Forbidden City complex, Chow Yin Fat wanted to stay and defend the base from panicked civilians and zombies, but Dr. Google convinced him that they needed to get him out of the city and back to Echo Base Australia to save the world.

The team secures the kite gift for Molly Simms and the alien power supply before working their way through a secret exit in the base, where Myne and Seto notice Edward Sherman using the escape route as well, looking awfully guilty.  Putting two and two together leads the team to believe Edward Sherman not only helped breached Beijing, but also was probably responsible for the fall of New Saigon as well.

The team pretends to be happy to see Edward, and makes their way out of the city.  A car bomb is activated 15 miles out, and between Dr. Google and Myne, they're able to disarm it just in time.  It seems that the bomb was specifically targeted for Seto, but nobody can figure out exactly how they knew Seto was going to be in that car.  Even more odd was that the particular explosives used are sourced exclusively from the US military.

During quarantine for Tianjin, the team extracts the tracking bug from Chow Yin Fat, steals Edward's boots, plants the tracker in his boots, and returns the boots back to Edward's room.  Unfortunately, Dr. Google wasn't able to change the frequency on the bug, so now Medusa can see the tracker again (even though they probably still believe it is Chow Yin Fat).

Edward goes on his way, and the team returns to find the Mingo unattended by any guards.  Calling Echo Base, they learn the Mingo has been radio silent for two days.  Checking against the hull, the team hears zombie activity, and knows the crew of 60 is lost.  Echo Base is informed of the situation, and the Mingo is targeted by battleship fire from off the coast, and explodes into scrap metal and chunks of zombie flesh.
