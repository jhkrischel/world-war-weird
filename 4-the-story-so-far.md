# January 1, 1944 - Echo Base Australia

The team practices against robot drones in a simulated hostage rescue mission in the middle of the outback.

# January 6, 1944 to January 14, 1944 - New Free Saigon

The team makes it through the jungle, past the quarantine, past four Ninjas of Medusa, to finally rescue and return Dr. Vinh Man Dan.

# Jaunary 20, 1944 to February 14, 1944 - The Forbidden City

The team arrives at Tianjin, and convoys to Beijing.  Yvormes and Dr. Google perform an analysis on an alien artifact held by the Chinese army, and determine it to be a power source.

When finally sent to meet Chow Yin Fat, they find him missing from his office, kidnapped by Medusa.  They find the mole, and trace her back to Du Tu Soon, an opium addled spymaster.

Interrogating Du Tu Soon, the team performs a successful canyon ambush, and rescues Chow Yin Fat.  Chow Yin Fat was tagged with a subdermal tracking bug, disabled by Dr. Google with some tin foil.  Unfortunately, their escape plan was disrupted when the helicopters they brought got into a fight with enemy helicopters, so they retreated to a nearby abandoned mine complex.

After evading zombies in the mine complex, the team had to evade Medusa patrols until they could be picked up by helicopter for flight back to Beijing.

Arriving in Beijing, the team finds the city in chaos.  Someone actually killed some guards and made a purposeful breach in the city shortly after midnight, and zombies have been rampaging until dawn.  Dropped off in the Forbidden City complex, Chow Yin Fat wanted to stay and defend the base from panicked civilians and zombies, but Dr. Google convinced him that they needed to get him out of the city and back to Echo Base Australia to save the world.

The team secures the kite gift for Molly Simms and the alien power supply before working their way through a secret exit in the base, where Myne and Seto notice Edward Sherman using the escape route as well, looking awfully guilty.  Putting two and two together leads the team to believe Edward Sherman not only helped breached Beijing, but also was probably responsible for the fall of New Saigon as well.

The team pretends to be happy to see Edward, and makes their way out of the city.  A car bomb is activated 15 miles out, and between Dr. Google and Myne, they're able to disarm it just in time.  It seems that the bomb was specifically targeted for Seto, but nobody can figure out exactly how they knew Seto was going to be in that car.  Even more odd was that the particular explosives used are sourced exclusively from the US military.

During quarantine for Tianjin, the team extracts the tracking bug from Chow Yin Fat, steals Edward's boots, plants the tracker in his boots, and returns the boots back to Edward's room.  Unfortunately, Dr. Google wasn't able to change the frequency on the bug, so now Medusa can see the tracker again (even though they probably still believe it is Chow Yin Fat).

Edward goes on his way, and the team returns to find the Mingo unattended by any guards.  Calling Echo Base, they learn the Mingo has been radio silent for two days.  Checking against the hull, the team hears zombie activity, and knows the crew of 60 is lost.  Echo Base is informed of the situation, and the Mingo is targeted by battleship fire from off the coast, and explodes into scrap metal and chunks of zombie flesh.

# February 14, 1944 to March 3, 1944 - Tokyo Wako

The team fends off three wings of Medusa Torpedo Bombers on the USS Arizona, and manages to fend off another kidnap attempt on Chow Yin Fat.

Arriving in Yokosuka, the team follows Edward Sherman's tracker into a rail way tunnel in the Yokosuka Rail Yard, and Dr. Google deduces that Edward was in fact abducted by Medusa and taken prisoner in a pachinko casino vault in Tokyo run by Medusa.

Seto manages to take a job as a security guard at the casino, and Dr. Google passes a bad check with the cashier.  Myne then comes in and accuses Dr. Google of passing the bad check in front of the manager.  The manager is convinced to let Seto take them down to the lower levels for "interrogation".

At the vault, Myne quickly cracks the code and finds Edward Sherman chained to the wall with some alien handcuffs.  Myne cracks the cuffs, while Dr. Google outside is found by some guards.  Seto manages to convince them that the interrogation is still going on, and helps Myne drag Edward Sherman's body through the vents from the vault to the interrogation room.  Dr. Google consults with Yvormes, and determines Edward Sherman is in fact Fremulon, an advance guard for a upcoming Fremulon invasion.  Myne slits Edward Sherman's throat, and the crew escapes through the air vents back into the city.

Yvormes rejoins the team after being convicted of theft by alien authorities and sentenced to permanent earth exile.  While at trial, friends of his father manage to pass on some helpful technology to aid in his survival during his exile, including a matter phaser that provides significant help in overcoming physical obstacles.

Yvormes' father clues the team into another Fremulon agent location, this one apparently stuck in their statis chamber, undisturbed by the alien zombie plague signal.  The stasis chamber is located in a mausoleum on the outskirts of Tokyo.  The team runs into some minor zombie presence on the way, but manages to get into the mausoleum to open the sarcophagus.  Once open, Myne is just a bit too curious, and touches the Fremulon, who wakes up and attacks Myne.  Yvormes quickly puts down the Fremulon with his stun gun, and the team manages to retrieve the Fremulon Communication Bracelet.

Dr. Google investigates the sarcophagus further, and triggers a booby trap.  Braving certain doom, Dr. Google works through some painful electrical discharge security measures, and manages to disarm the trap.  Further investigation reveals that there are 24 Fremulon agents on earth ahead of the invasion, and the invasion fleet is due in 2 years.

Dr. Google, Yvormes, and Myne are kidnapped by Fremulon Battle Bots, and brought in high tech body bags to a Fremulon Secret base, where they are stored in cell block AA24.  They escape their cell, and find the Real Edward Sherman, who comes along to help them get out of the base.  They manage to salvage the body bags they were brought in, which compress down into small cubes, and should be good as improvised life support systems.

On a level of traps, they manage to fight their way past a land shark, some battle bots, a puzzle room, and find some interesting information about Fremulons, the smell of strawberries, and a fear of cold weather.  In a shower section of the level, they meet the mysterious and sensual Fremulon agent, "The Lady", who intimidates everyone except for Edward Sherman.  Ed manages to frighten The Lady off, and the team makes their way up to the shuttle bay.

Once in the shuttle bay, Dr. Google, Yvormes, and Myne manage to breach one of the shuttles, and damage the shuttle bay door to allow it to flood after they escape another wave of Fremulon Battle Bots.  

# March 3, 1944 - March 10, 1944

The team is hunted by three wings of Fremulon fighters, which manage to do a fair bit of damage to the shuttle before Dr. Google is able to activate stealth mode, and Yvormes is able to sneak away.  During the battle, they call upon Sgt. Simms to call in an attack on the Fremulon Carrier, but the attack is ordered to stop, and Sgt. Simms tells the team that they've been compromised before being taken off the air.  General Veers demands the team return to base, but the team pretends to have communication problems.

The team lands on the abandoned island of Iwo Jima, and finds their scanners and engines disabled.  Searching the underground base there, they find a hidden control center, and disable the jammer.  Unfortunately, this gives the Allied Forces under General Veers a lock on their communication devices.  Planning to leave their communication devices behind, the team heads to the shuttle, but the jamming device is reactivated, and Yvormes heads back to the control room they found.

As Yvormes enters, a man huddled over the screens in the control room grumbles, "You guys are late!"

Before General Veers and his ground team arrive via transport plane, the team follows the mysterious Mr. Who into a secret extension to the underground base.

Disoriented at times, Mr. Who explains to the team that he comes from a future where the Allied Forces prevented the creation of a Zombie Cure, and were then stuck in a decades long war with the Fremulon invaders.  Mr. Who was sent back with technology from Yvormes' father from the year 2014, and the only hope the world has is to stop the Allied Forces from their nefarious plot, so that a unified earth can repel the alien invasion.

Mr. Who gives the team four targets - four other teams that were given the same mission profile they were.  Team Philadelphia working in North Africa/Middle East, Team Salem working in South Africa, Team Baton Rouge working in South America, and Team Newport working in Europe.

In order to find Team Philadelphia, Team Manhattan needs to find their communication frequency and crypto protocols (either from the Pentagon or from Echo Base), and needs to obtain several parts for a communications interception device.  Required parts include a ten point weeble-frobber from the Giza Pyramids, a flux superconductor held at Edwards AFB, and a hydraulic capacitor kept at Fort Knox.

Using a high speed submarine provided by Mr. Who, the team first retrieves the ten point weeble-frobber from the pyramid of Kafre.  They hijack an armored messenger car outside of the Suez Canal installation, drive to the Giza Pyramids, sneak in through a secret entrance at the top of the pyramid, and then through hidden tunnels, reach a central chamber where the Master Cultist is guiding his minions in worship.

Dr. Google pretends to be the voice of Osiris, and convinces the cultists to leave while he consults with the Master Cultist.  They buy the ruse, and leave, but the Master Cultist is suspicious, and arms himself with a heavy machine gun.  Yvormes, helped by Myne and Dr. Google, sets of a chain reaction of falling urns, statues, and funerary, that crushes the Master Cultist.  Yvormes pulls the ten point weeble-frobber off of the Master Cultist's neck, and the team escapes back out the secret entrance, after informing the returning cultists, in the voice of Osiris, that the Master Cultist was found unworthy and crushed.


# February 14, 1944 to March 3, 1944 - Tokyo Wako Flashback

Seto is given a secret quest to retrieve cleaning rags from the Kamakura Buddha, by the ninja masters disguised as janitorial staff at Tokyo University.  Seto convinces the group to search for Watanabe there, without giving away his secret mission.

The team fights off some fremulon ninja bots, and then have to fight of the Kamakura Buddha itself, which was turned into a battle bot by fremulon nanites.  The team succeeds, destroying the opposition, and Seto quietly pockets the cleaning rags he was supposed to retrieve.  As part of the investigation of the wreckage, they learn that 10 of the original Kamakura monks were actually fremulon agents, who killed all the other monks.

Returning to Tokyo University, Seto is given detailed location information by his ninja master for Watanabe.  The team heads out to the Toro dig site, where Watanabe-san is working.  On the way to the site, Seto, the crazy asian driver, ignores his check engine light, and the jeep breaks down on the south slope of Mount Fuji, where they fight off a handful of zombies.

Myne repairs the jeep, and the group heads on to the Toro dig site.  The team is subjected to a routine quarantine again, and Dr. Wiki Google helps Watanabe break through a lock on the 3rd level of the dig.  The entire site is generally constructed of materials impervious to any harm by human weaponry.

On their way through the new levels, Seto is snapped up by a trap door and sent down into the detention level 20.

Various medical robots attack the team, trying to "fix" the fact that they have two arms (rather than one as the original aliens did).  The team fights back, which triggers repair robots to come, and they follow the repair robots down the service elevator, trying to reach Seto.

Seto manages to fight off several medical robots that come after him, and starts working his way out of the detention center to meet back up with the rest of the team.

Investigating the base the team learns that the site belonged to the Raleks - one armed aliens who had originally lived where the crab nebulae is today (their homeworld vaporized).  They came to earth to stop an airborne version of ebola that would have wiped out humanity, after the fremulons had already arrived (although they never interacted with them).  Apparently the Raleks were responsible for much of Nordic culture as well.

Their base had gone into hibernation after their homeworld was destroyed, but only one of the cryo tubes they had was still in working order.  As the base begins to tear itself apart (the reactivated systems start to overload), the team rescues the last Ralek, escapes the base, as an explosion of epic proportions spews into the sky.  As the team drives away escaping with the jeep, Mount Fuji erupts in front of them, set off by the exploding base.
