* Because I am a **Lady's Man**, I get +2 when I cleverly create advantages against women through speech and seduction.
* Because I am a **Conceited Bastard**, I get +2 when I flashily kill in defense of an animal.
* Because I am a **Good Mechanic**, once per game I can fashion a makeshift poor (-1) weapon no matter where I am.
