# Myne

# High Concept: a paper clip, duct tape, and a nut walks into a bar

A cocky lady's man and mechanic with a love of practical jokes who finds himself in a few too many sticky situations due to his wit.

# Trouble: Curiosity killed the cat

Myne just can't stop poking at things, or pushing red buttons, or looking into boxes he shouldn't.

# First Adventure: I love too, kill

Captured by the father of paramour, Myne escaped from the prison designed by Dr. Google, and killed *everyone*.

# Guest Star: Soft kitty, warm kitty

Total animal lover.
