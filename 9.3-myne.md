# Myne

# High Concept: a paper clip, duct tape, and a nut walks into a bar

A cocky lady's man and mechanic with a love of practical jokes who finds himself in a few too many sticky situations due to his wit.

## Invokes

* Myne is a master of technical improvisation, so he can spend a fate point to either re-roll or get a +2 on a Crafts create advantage roll.

## Compels

* Event: You have the **a paper clip, duct tape, and a nut walks into a bar** aspect, and when wooing a potential conquest, unfortunately, they turn out to be a thief that robs you blind and leaves you tied naked to the bed.  Damn your luck.

* Decision: You have the **a paper clip, duct tape, and a nut walks into a bar** aspect, and the bad guy you're fighting is really uptight, so it makes sense that you'd decide to taunt him.  This goes wrong when he gets so angry he calls in reinforcements.

# Trouble: Curiosity killed the cat

Myne just can't stop poking at things, or pushing red buttons, or looking into boxes he shouldn't.

## Invokes

* Myne has an uncanny knack for looking around where nobody else does, so he can spend a fate point to either re-roll or get a +2 on a Notice overcome roll.

## Compels

* Event: You have the **Curiosity killed the cat** aspect, and there was a shiny red button you pushed earlier in the villain's lair, unfortunately, the shiny red button happened to activate a series of booby traps.  Damn your luck.

* Decision: You have the **Curiosity killed the cat** aspect, and there's an unlabeled syringe on the corpse of a bad guy, so it makes sense that you'd decide to taste it to see what's in it.  This goes wrong when it turns out to be a powerful hallucinogen.

# First Adventure: I love too, kill

Captured by the father of paramour, Myne escaped from the prison designed by Dr. Google, and killed *everyone*.

## Invokes

* Myne has a true love of killing machines, so he can spend a fate point to either re-roll or get a +2 on a Shoot attack.

## Compels

* Event: You have the **I love too, kill** aspect, and there was this one really hot chick you tagged while stationed in China, unfortunately, she got pregnant and wants to dump the baby with you.  Damn your luck.

* Decision: You have the **I love too, kill** aspect, and you're fighting a bunch of bad guys, so it makes sense that you'd decide to shoot to kill.  This goes wrong when it turns out that the last one you shot was holding a dead man's switch for a bunch of explosives.
