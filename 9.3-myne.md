# Myne

# High Concept: a paper clip, duct tape, and a nut walks into a bar

A cocky lady's man and mechanic with a love of practical jokes who finds himself in a few too many sticky situations due to his wit.

# Trouble: Curiosity killed the cat

Myne just can't stop poking at things, or pushing red buttons, or looking into boxes he shouldn't.

# First Adventure: I love too, kill

Captured by the father of paramour, Myne escaped from the prison designed by Dr. Google, and killed *everyone*.

# Guest Star: Soft kitty, warm kitty

Total animal lover.

# STUNTS

## FAE Style

* Because I am a **Lady's Man**, I get +2 when I cleverly create advantages against women through speech and seduction.
* Because I am a **Conceited Bastard**, I get +2 when I flashily kill in defense of an animal.
* Because I am a **Good Mechanic**, once per game I can fashion a makeshift poor (-1) weapon no matter where I am.

## Fate Core Style

* Burglary: Always A Way Out (+2 on Burglary create advantage when trying to escape)
* Deceive: Lies upon lies (+2 create advantage against someone who you already created an advantage against this session)
* Crafts: Better than new (Succeed with style on overcome action to repair machinery creates permanent aspect with one free invoke instead of just a boost)
