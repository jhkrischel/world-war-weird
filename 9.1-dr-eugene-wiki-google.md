# Dr. Eugene Wiki Google

# High Concept: Human Encyclopedia of Adventure!

With an eidetic memory, Dr. Google was recruited by the U.S. military in 1889 at age 10, and was shipped around the world to view every document possible.  Now 65 years old (as of 1944), Mr. Google is a valuable asset with covert operations given his encyclopedic knowledge of *everything*.

## Invokes

* Dr. Google's prior military training taught him a bit about marksmanship, so he can spend a fate point to either re-roll or get a +2 on a Shoot attack.

## Compels

* Event: You have the **Human Encyclopedia of Adventure!** aspect, and are confidently navigating the streets of the city based on your prior knowledge, unfortunately, there was massive reconstruction since the last map you saw so you get lost in a bad part of town with some thugs that take notice of you.  Damn your luck.

* Decision: You have the **Human Encyclopedia of Adventure!** aspect, and are trying to manufacture some explosives in an unfamiliar lab, so it makes sense that you'd decide to trust the labeling of the reagents available.  This goes wrong when it turns out that the chemicals are improperly labeled and the resultant mixture destroys most of the lab.

# Trouble: I'm Getting Too Old For This Shit

Although a valuable asset, Dr. Google is not particularly suited for combat, both because of his age and his bookish nature.

## Invokes

* Dr. Google's prior experience in the field has taught him a bit about ducking down, so he can spend a fate point to either re-roll or get a +2 on an Athletics defend action.

## Compels

* Event: You have the **I'm Getting Too Old For This Shit** aspect, and are chasing down an escaping bad guy, unfortunately, your bum knee gives out and not only do you fall down, you take out your other team members too and the bad guy gets away.  Damn your luck.

* Decision: You have the **I'm Getting Too Old For This Shit** aspect, and when your team decides to split up, it makes sense that you'd decide to stay behind and guard the camp.  This goes wrong when it turns out that the bad guys were waiting for you to be separated from your team so they could kidnap you.

# First Adventure: Better Living Through Chemistry -> Elementary, my dear Watson.

Dr. Google's thorough knowledge of chemistry allowed him to create a highly potent acid which he used to carve an entrance into the Lost Sub-basement of Alexandria, a part of the great library that was preserved from destruction, and also happened to contain some significant alien artifacts and documentation.

## Invokes

* Dr. Google's chemistry experience includes complex organic acids, so he can spend a fate point to either re-roll or get a +2 on a Lore overcome action against a locked door.

## Compels

* Event: You have the **Better Living Through Chemistry** aspect, and are preparing some concoctions for combat, unfortunately, the ingredients weren't as potent as you had hoped and they're doomed to fizzle.  Damn your luck.

* Decision: You have the **Better Living Through Chemistry** aspect, and when your team finds a cache of illegal drugs, it makes sense that you'd decide to test the substances by tasting them.  This goes wrong when it turns out that one of them is a highly hallucinogenic drug and you gain the aspect **Tripping Balls**.

# Guest Star: Ooops.

Dr. Google was in charge of building an inescapable jail cell, but forgot to protect the door hinges.

## Invokes

* Dr. Google's long life has included recognizing lots and lots of mistakes, so he can spend a fate point to either re-roll or get a +2 on a Crafts create advantage action.

## Compels

* Event: You have the **Ooops** aspect, and are handling a rare alien artifact, unfortunately, you lose your grip and the artifact falls to the floor and destroys itself in a puff of smoke.  Damn your luck.

* Decision: You have the **Ooops** aspect, and as you enter a room with your team, you decide to close the door behind you.  This goes wrong when it turns out that the door is locked from the outside.
