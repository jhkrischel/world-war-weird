# Dr. Eugene Wiki Google

# High Concept: Human Encyclopedia of Adventure!

With an eidetic memory, Dr. Google was recruited by the U.S. military in 1889 at age 10, and was shipped around the world to view every document possible.  Now 65 years old (as of 1944), Mr. Google is a valuable asset with covert operations given his encyclopedic knowledge of *everything*.

# Trouble: I'm Getting Too Old For This Shit

Although a valuable asset, Dr. Google is not particularly suited for combat, both because of his age and his bookish nature.

# First Adventure: Better Living Through Chemistry

Dr. Google's thorough knowledge of chemistry allowed him to create a highly potent acid which he used to carve an entrance into the Lost Sub-basement of Alexandria, a part of the great library that was preserved from destruction, and also happened to contain some significant alien artifacts and documentation.

# Guest Star: Ooops.

Dr. Google was in charge of building an inescapable jail cell, but forgot to protect the door hinges.
