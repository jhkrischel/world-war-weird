## Scenarios

### The Fall of Saigon

The first rescue is for Dr. Vinh Man Dan in New Free Saigon.  Since there is a naval blockade, a direct approach is impossible.  The team will be inserted via submarine, east up the coast of the main harbor entrance (https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Khu+bảo+tồn+thiên+nhiên+Bình+Châu+-+Phước+Bửu/@10.518294,107.467686,13z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x252ed8a21cef22ff?hl=en_uk).  The journey through the jungle is approximately 65 miles, which will take approximately 7 days.

The countryside is infested by zombies, although not in particularly large groups.

* Will the characters be able to make it through the jungle to the outskirts of Saigon?
* Will the characters be able to convince the New Free Saigon authorities to let them in past quarantine?
* Will the characters be able to bring Dr. Vinh Man Dan safely back to the extraction submarine?
