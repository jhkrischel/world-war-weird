## Scenarios

### The Fall of Saigon

The first rescue is for Dr. Vinh Man Dan in New Free Saigon.  Since there is a naval blockade, a direct approach is impossible.  The team will be inserted via submarine, [east up the coast of the main harbor entrance](https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Khu+bảo+tồn+thiên+nhiên+Bình+Châu+-+Phước+Bửu/@10.518294,107.467686,13z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x252ed8a21cef22ff?hl=en_uk).  The journey through the jungle is approximately 65 miles, which will take approximately 7 days on foot.

New Free Saigon is currently ruled by [Jean Decoux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Decoux), who has maintained a strict quarantine zone around the city - no visitors are allowed in or out.  Trade on the docks is done without allowing any contact between city dwellers, and ship crews.  Occasional forays by armed patrols are made for food inland, but they are subject to a strict 5 day quarantine when returning to the city.

The countryside is infested by zombies, although not in particularly large groups.

The team has been equipped with alien communication devices, each the size of a pack of cigarettes, with effectively unlimited range - direct communications back to Area 51 and Echo Base Australia are possible.

### The Forbidden City

Attention team!  Dr. Vinh Man Dan has been successfully transferred to the USS Dennis J. Buckley, and is heading back to Area 51.  Unfortunately, shortly after you left New Free Saigon, it fell to the plague - we'll be closely monitoring you and the submarine crew for any signs of latent infection.

Our next mission is the recovery and return of Colonel Chow Yin Fat, a weapons and technology expert who worked for the late President Chiang Kai-shek.  Acting president Lin Sen has agreed to arrange a military escort you from Binhai, Tianjin, to the Forbidden City in Beijing.  You'll continue on in the USS Mingo to Tianjin, where you'll meet Sgt. Bai Wen Shang, who will take you from there to Beijing.  On a personal note, there's word of a kite festival in Bejing this month - little Molly Simms sure would like it if you'd bring back a genuine Chinese kite on your way back to Echo Base!

### Tokyo Wako

Attention team!  The loss of the USS Mingo and her crew is mourned by all here at Echo Base.  We're just grateful your team wasn't among the victims.

The USS Arizona, that was called in to scuttle the USS Mingo from offshore, is our only available transport at this time in the area.  While we would like to have Colonel Fat join us here at Echo Base as soon as possible, you are urgently needed to pursue Edward Sherman, suspected of causing the catastrophic zed breaches at both New Saigon and Beijing.  Yokosuka is the only open quarantine port in all of Japan, and we are tracking Mr. Sherman on a transport scheduled to arrive there with delivery supplies.

It is imperative that you discover who Mr. Sherman is working for, so that we can begin to combat their threat.

The next scheduled target for retrieval is Professor Kiyoshi Watanabe of Tokyo University.  He's a theoretical mathemetician who is needed for statistical computing analysis on the zombie plague.
