## Scenarios

### The Fall of Saigon

The first rescue is for Dr. Vinh Man Dan in New Free Saigon.  Since there is a naval blockade, a direct approach is impossible.  The team will be inserted via submarine, east up the coast of the main harbor entrance (https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Khu+bảo+tồn+thiên+nhiên+Bình+Châu+-+Phước+Bửu/@10.518294,107.467686,13z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x252ed8a21cef22ff?hl=en_uk).  The journey through the jungle is approximately 65 miles, which will take approximately 7 days on foot.

New Free Saigon is currently ruled by [Jean Decoux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Decoux), who has maintained a strict quarantine zone around the city - no visitors are allowed in or out.  Trade on the docks is done without allowing any contact between city dwellers, and ship crews.  Occasional forays by armed patrols are made for food inland, but they are subject to a strict 5 day quarantine when returning to the city.

The countryside is infested by zombies, although not in particularly large groups.

* Will the characters be able to make it through the jungle to the outskirts of Saigon?
* Will the characters be able to convince the New Free Saigon authorities to let them in past quarantine?
* Will the characters be able to bring Dr. Vinh Man Dan safely back to the extraction submarine?
