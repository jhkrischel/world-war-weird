# Xi'An Yvormes

# High Concept: Alien love-child, prodigy

Xi'An is the product of the sweet love between an alien father, and a human mother.

# Trouble: Out of this world daddy issues

Xi'An's father is a literal voice in his head, thanks to a Jor-El crystal style implant that is constantly criticizing him.  Xi'An's father was an anthropologist, and terribly disappointed that his son decided on an engineering career path rather than an academic one.

# First Adventure: Are you my mommy

Xi'An fled his homeworld by hacking into an unmanned space freighter headed towards earth, for the sole purpose of finding his mommy.  His mommy search was cut short when he was captured by U.S. Special Forces operating in occupied France.

# Guest Star: No.  Please.  Stop.

On a field trip to earth, Xi'An met Dr. Eugene Wiki Google and his spy partner in a hidden catacomb of the Library of Alexandria.  Despite his Wonka-style warnings to them not to proceed into a certain room that was trapped by alien technology, they went ahead anyway.

* Because I have **Alien Mind Powers**, once per session I can make all enemies -1 for the duration of the combat.
* Because I am **Half Alien**, I get a +2 when I cleverly create an advantage when I use alien technology.
