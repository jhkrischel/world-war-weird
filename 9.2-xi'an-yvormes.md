# Xi'An Yvormes

# High Concept: Alien love-child, prodigy

Xi'An is the product of the sweet love between an alien father, and a human mother.

## Invokes

* Yvormes knows a lot about alien tech, so he can spend a fate point to either re-roll or get a +2 on a Crafts create advantage roll.

## Compels

* Event: You have the **Alien love-child, prodigy** aspect, and when encountering an alien, unfortunately, they recognize you as part alien and enable their anti-alien countermeasures to make your stun gun ineffective.  Damn your luck.

* Decision: You have the **Alien love-child, prodigy** aspect, and have taken out a literal bastard in a conflict, so it makes sense that you'd decide to spare him and let him go.  This goes wrong when the bastard surprises you and attacks you again, with fresh vigor!

# Trouble: Out of this world daddy issues

Xi'An's father is a literal voice in his head, thanks to a Jor-El crystal style implant that is constantly criticizing him.  Xi'An's father was an anthropologist, and terribly disappointed that his son decided on an engineering career path rather than an academic one.

## Invokes

* Yvormes has his father in his head making him generally jittery and paranoid, so he can spend a fate point to either re-roll or get a +2 on a Notice overcome roll.

## Compels

* Event: You have the **Out of this world daddy issues** aspect, and when in tense negotiations, unfortunately, you start talking to the voices in your head and the negotiations fail.  Damn your luck.

* Decision: You have the **Out of this world daddy issues** aspect, and your father's voice is telling you to choose the door on the left, so it makes sense that you'd decide to choose the door on the right in spite.  This goes wrong when it turns out that the door on the right is booby trapped.

# First Adventure: Are you my mommy

Xi'An fled his homeworld by hacking into an unmanned space freighter headed towards earth, for the sole purpose of finding his mommy.  His mommy search was cut short when he was captured by U.S. Special Forces operating in occupied France.  While in custody, the government agreed to help him with his quest if he would sign on as an advisor to the Manhattan Project.

## Invokes

* Yvormes has spent great effort learning the tricks of investigation looking for his mommy, so he can spend a fate point to either re-roll or get a +2 on an Investigate overcome roll.

## Compels

* Event: You have the **Are you my mommy** aspect, and you've had quite a few possible leads, unfortunately, one of the leads you followed ended up being psychopath who now wants to kill you.  Slowly.  Damn your luck.

* Decision: You have the **Are you my mommy** aspect, and you are confronted with a possible match, so it makes sense that you'd decide to investigate closer.  This goes wrong when it turns out that the match was actually a trap set by Medusa to kidnap you.

# Guest Star: No.  Please.  Stop.

On a field trip to earth, Xi'An met Dr. Eugene Wiki Google and his spy partner in a hidden catacomb of the Library of Alexandria.  Despite his Wonka-style warnings to them not to proceed into a certain room that was trapped by alien technology, they went ahead anyway.

## Invokes

* Yvormes has an uncanny ability to know when someone is about to make a grave technical mistake building something, so he can spend a fate point to either re-roll or get a +2 on Crafts create advantage roll.

## Compels

* Event: You have the **No.  Please.  Stop.** aspect, and you've passively warned someone about an impending doom that they went off and stepped into anyway, unfortunately, the doom had an area affect that included where you're standing.  Damn your luck.

* Decision: You have the **No.  Please.  Stop.** aspect, and you're tired of always telling people they're about to make a mistake, so it makes sense that you'd decide to just let it go this one time.  This goes wrong when it turns out that you were right again, and the mistake happens to hit *you* instead of the person who made the mistake.
